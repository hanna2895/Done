# Done

Have you ever wanted to get all your shopping done easily and securely, from one place? This application will allow you to do just that.

I wireframed and built the prototype for this application in one day at a General Assembly UX Design Bootcamp, with a team of 4 others. The task was to come up with a solution that incorporated one-click payments and improves the online shopping experience. I'm hoping to build out the application as best as I can to continue practicing my skills and learn more about e-commerce, payments, and progressive web applications (PWAs).
